    <h1>Cornell Mafia Club</h1>
    <p>
    The Cornell Mafia Club is a student-run organization that holds weekly
    meetings for the purpose of playing Mafia, a role-playing game that blends
    the logical and the psychological with a twist of mystery. In every match,
    an uninformed majority faces off against a hidden, well-informed minority
    in a battle for the ages, moderated by whichever member feels brave enough
    to put their own game design to the test. Membership is free, easy, and
    simple: just show up! The club meets every Friday night at the Keeton House
    Common Room, 9 p.m. Drinks and snacks are provided, courtesy of Keeton
    House.

    <h2 id="rules">Rules</h2>
    <p>
    The game begins with the night phase.
    </p>

    <h3>Night</h3>
    <p>
    The moderator wakes up the Mafia. The Mafia agree on a player to kill as a
    group. Other players are woken up to perform their night actions.
    </p>

    <h3>Day</h3>
    <p>
    All of the players wake up, usually discovering a that one of the members
    of the town has died. The day phase consists of 4 distinct phases.
    <ol>
      <li>First players form a block. In order to be put on the block a player
        must first be nominated and then seconded by two different players.
      </li>
      <li>When 2-3 players are on the block each of the players on the block
        give a defense.
      </li>
      <li>
        All of the members of the town are then given a few minutes to discuss
        who should be lynched.
      </li>
      <li>Finally the town votes on the people on the block and the person who
        recieves the most votes is killed.
      </li>
      <li>After voting all of the players go to sleep for the night and the
        cycle repeats.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
    In addition, during the day, players may motion for a "no lynch" or a
    "reblock" at any point during the day (except during voting). If another
    player seconds this motion either the town proceeds directly to the night
    phase or the current block is disbanded and a new different one is formed.
    Each one of these options can be used at most once per game.
    </p>

    <h3>Game End</h3>
    <p>
    The game ends when the town has succeeded at killing all of the Mafia or the
    Mafia has succeeded at gaining control of the town.
    </p>
